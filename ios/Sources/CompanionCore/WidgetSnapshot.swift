// What a home-screen widget renders: the app's updates, frozen on disk.

// The widget extension is a separate process on a system-budgeted timeline,

// `updates` the pill reads — one Codable file in the App Group — and the
// widgets read it back exactly as written. The face is resolved at write
// time into a plain string because the widget has no state to resolve it
// from; `writtenAt` is what lets a widget say how old it is instead of
// pretending the last write is current.
